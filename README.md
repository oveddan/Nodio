  Chat room for a musical instrument - let's people play a live instrument for each other in real time over the web, in any browser.

## Setup

  Install dependencies:
  
    $ npm install

  Start server:

    $ node app.js

  Connect to an instrument by opening http://localhost:3000/{instrumentName}
  Open it in another browser, connected to that host and port, and press a key - it will be played
  in all browsers connected to that instrument.

## Running tests

    $ npm install -d
